WIP!<br>
Portfolio style website to demonstrate skills and knowledge, while also providing access to code for review by interested parties.
Will be adding and removing pages, skills and any relevant things on actual site as see fit. Hopefully making it look good, professional and interetsing
Hoping to use to help find jobs in development.
